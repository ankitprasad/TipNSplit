# TipNSync

- NOTE: As mentioned in your tutorial, I didn't design the storyboard with size classes, so please run simulator in iPhone 5 size.

How many hours did it take to complete?
- I was able to complete the basic project in an hour. 
- Doing the nicer version with all the optional stuff (and a few of my own touches) took 7 hours total. It took me this long as I really wanted to use a spinner (UIPickerView) for selecting the tip, and I ran into a couple of bugs with using UIPickerView that I had to debug by Googling. (This was also my first time with Swift, I've only used Java and C++ before)

Which required and optional stories have you completed?
- I completed all the required stories: I created a tip calculator, that lets you select from a number of tip options
- OPTIONAL: I used a custom app icon and launch page
- OPTIONAL: I used/added a custom font
- OPTIONAL: I used animations by fading items in with UIView.animatewithduration
- TRULY OPTIONAL: I tried out different input formats including a spinner (UIPickerView) - aside from a segmented control and a text input field. Also added some design touches like a background image.
